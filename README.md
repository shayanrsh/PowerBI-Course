This is a course project for [Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop), which teaches how to use Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports.

## What I Learned ðŸ’¡

In this course, I learned how to:

- Connect to various data sources, such as Excel, CSV, web, SQL Server, and more.
- Transform and clean data using Power Query Editor.
- Create relationships and data models using Power BI Desktop.
- Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures.
- Visualize data using various charts, maps, tables, slicers, and more.
- Apply filters, slicers, and drill-downs to make the dashboards interactive.
- Publish and share the dashboards and reports with others.

## What I Achieved ðŸŒŸ

As a final project, I created a dashboard that shows the sales performance of a fictional company called Adventure Works. The dashboard has four pages:

- **Overview:** This page shows the total sales, profit, and profit margin by year, quarter, and month. It also has a map that shows the sales by country and a bar chart that shows the top 10 products by sales.
- **Sales by Category:** This page shows the sales by product category and subcategory. It also has a pie chart that shows the sales by customer segment and a line chart that shows the sales trend by month.
- **Sales by Region:** This page shows the sales by sales territory and region. It also has a donut chart that shows the sales by sales channel and a stacked column chart that shows the sales by product category and region.
- **Sales by Customer:** This page shows the sales by customer name and city. It also has a tree map that shows the sales by product subcategory and a scatter chart that shows the relationship between sales and profit by customer.
